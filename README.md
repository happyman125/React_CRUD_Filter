# Plexxis Interview Exercise
## Requirements
Create a simple CRUD application that can do the following:

1) Retrieve a list of employees from a REST API  
2) Display the list in a table in a React application  
3) Add buttons for creating and deleting employees  
4) Add API endpoints to create and delete employees  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The front-end app runs off localhost:3000. The REST API is located in the /server folder and runs off localhost:8080. The data is being served from a JSON file located in the /server/data folder. Run `npm start` to start both servers.

## Bonus

1) Use a relational database to store the data (SQLite, MariaDB, Postgres)  
2) Edit/update employee data  
3) Use [React Table](https://react-table.js.org)  
4) Show us your design skills on the front-end  

You are not required to do any of the above bonus tasks. What we are more interested in is your ability to communicate your decisions. You are free to use whatever libraries that you want, but again be prepared to defend your decisions. 

This is your chance to amaze us with your talent!
